# Home - 11637 - Foundations of Computational Data Science

## 1. Overview

**Title:** Foundations of Computational Data Science

**Units:** 11-637 is 12 units.

**Pre-requisites:** Significant programming experience in Python (ability to design, implement and debug non-trivial programs). Ability to pick up other programming languages as needed.

**Course Format:** Remote Asynchronous (1st meeting of the semester is a live sessionâ€“details will be sent prior to start of the course)

## 2. Course Description
This course provides an introduction to foundational concepts, learning material, and projects related to the three core areas of Data Science: Computing Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. Students completing this class will be prepared for further graduate education in Data Science and/or Artificial Intelligence. Students acquire skills in solution design (e.g., architecture, framework APIs, cloud computing), analytic algorithms (e.g., classification, clustering, ranking, prediction), interactive analysis (Jupyter Notebook), and visualization techniques for data analysis, solution optimization, and performance measurement on real-world tasks.

## 3. Course Goals 
This course will equip students with the foundational knowledge of computational data science. Students will learn about the Data Science Process by completing projects that introduce problem identification, data gathering, exploratory data analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, model evaluation, and visualizing and interpreting results to inform the decision-making process. It is our goal that students will develop the skills needed to become a practitioner or carry out research projects in the domain of computational data science. Specifically, students are exposed to real-world data and scenarios in order to learn how to:
1. Define analytic requirements and develop appropriate questions to guide the solution design process. 
2. Design a data-gathering plan that incorporates principles of data governance and sovereignty to ensure usability, integrity, security, and availability of data. 
3. Use univariate and multivariate graphical and non-graphical techniques to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in large datasets.
4. Build and deploy models using the appropriate analytic algorithms (such as linear and logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, k-means, and hierarchical clustering, among others) to gain understanding from data, make predictions to solve business problems, and inform decision making.
5. Assess the goodness of fit between a model and data using model evaluation metrics and cross-validation frameworks to evaluate predictive models.

Through this process, we aspire for our students to become independent and resilient problem solvers who are able to overcome challenges and learn.
