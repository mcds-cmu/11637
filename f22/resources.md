## Office Hours

Each TA holds weekly office hours (OH) virtually via Zoom. Their office hours schedule can be found in the [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_44316fe6c0ba5b77d642da698381886b6092cfb10f9535c89b6af1f1e21b94ea%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York). All students who come for OH, please join the OH queue [https://www.eberly.cmu.edu/ohq/#/courses](https://www.eberly.cmu.edu/ohq/#/courses). Please do so even if the Zoom waiting room is empty or no one in the OH queue. Doing so is beneficial in the following ways:
- As you indicate your question when joining the OH queue, the TA can mentally prepare for the doubt better.
- It helps the TA keep track of the order of students who join the OH queue and the Zoom waiting room.
- It helps students to track their place in line properly without concern that the TA is not being tentative to them.
