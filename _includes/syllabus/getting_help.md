Students are encouraged to ask questions about content and projects through Piazza, where an online class portal has been created for this course.

Video recording of the weekly overview is available to all students every week. The teaching staff will discuss any major questions that have been posted to Piazza or by email. For urgent communication with the teaching staff, it is best to post on Piazza and then send an email.  

We will use the course website as the basic portal for the class. The course content is entirely on OLI.  The project write-ups, submission, scoreboard, and grades are on Sail() Platform. The checkpoint quizzes are on OLI. OLI can be accessed through Canvas. Announcements, discussions, and questions are posted on Piazza.
