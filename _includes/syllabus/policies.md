### Working Alone on Projects

Projects that are assigned to single students should be performed individually. All submitted work will be monitored by automatic cheat checker. For more details on cheating, see section 9.

### P/NP Grades
MCDS students cannot take this course P/NP. For non-MCDS students, please check with your program. For all students, to be considered a passing grade in the course, these two conditions must be met:

- All projects must be attempted, and at least some grades before the deadline must be non-zero

- Each of project 6 (Model Deployment and Comparison) and 7 (Evaluation Optimization) must achieve at least 80%

### Handing in Projects
All assessments are due at 11:59 PM EST (one minute before midnight) on the due dates specified on OLI or Sail() Platform. All hand-ins are electronic and use the OLI Checkpoint system and Sail() Platform. 

### Appealing Grades
After each project module is graded, you have seven calendar days to appeal your grade. All your appeals should be provided by email to Prof. Nyberg.
