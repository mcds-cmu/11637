### Working Alone on Projects

Projects that are assigned to single students should be performed individually. All submitted work will be monitored by an automatic cheat checker. For more details on cheating, see the section on Academic Integrity.

### P/NP Grades

MCDS students cannot take this course P/NP. For non-MCDS students, please check with your program.

### Threshold Requirements

For all students, to be considered a passing grade in the course, these two conditions must be met:
- All projects must be attempted, and at least some grades before the deadline must be non-zero.
- Each of project 2 (Problem Representation), project 6 (Model Deployment and Comparison) and project 7 (Evaluation Optimization) must achieve at least 80%.

These requirements are **in addition** to the standard grade scale evaluation criteria. If you failed to fulfill these requirements by their respective deadlines, you must contact us after the deadlines to continue fulfilling them until you meet the thresholds. Only after then would you be considered to have met the threshold requirements. However, any grade you achieve after the deadlines will not be counted towards the final grade calculation.


### Handing in Projects

All assessments are due at 11:59 PM EST (one minute before midnight) on the due dates specified on OLI or Sail() Platform. All hand-ins are electronic and use the OLI Checkpoint system and Sail() Platform.

### Appealing Grades

After each project module is graded, you have seven calendar days to appeal your grade. All your appeals should be provided by email to Prof. Nyberg.
