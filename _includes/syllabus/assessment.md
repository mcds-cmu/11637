### Formative Activities

Formative activities (“Learn by Doing” and “Did I Get This”), which are available on most pages in the OLI course, are simple, non-graded activities to assess your comprehension of the material as you read through the course material. You are advised to complete all of the formative activities before proceeding through to the next page or module. If you missed many of the activities, it is recommended that you review the material again.

### Weekly Checkpoint Quizzes

There are eight units consisting of modules of content on OLI. There are 11 Checkpoint quizzes that you must complete before the deadline posted on OLI. The quiz with the lowest score will be dropped. Among the 10 Checkpoint quizzes to be counted towards the final grade, each Checkpoint quiz will be worth 2% of your total grade. It is your responsibility to ensure that the quiz is submitted prior to the deadline. You will have only a single attempt and a fixed time limit to complete each Checkpoint Quiz on OLI.

### Coding Projects

This course includes seven individual project themes. Each project theme consists of several project modules. A project module has to be completed based on the deadlines posted on Sail() Platform. The discussion and reflection sections required to complete each project module are available on Sail() Platform. Each module has a submission process that is specific to the project module that is due. It is the students’ responsibility to make sure that all project work is completed and that the project module is submitted prior to the deadline. Students typically have multiple attempts to submit the project module on Sail() Platform.

### Manual-graded Components

In project 3 and the final exam, some components are manually graded questions. Students are required to submit a pdf or images of their work on Gradescope for manual grading.

### Final Exam

There are three components to the final exam: the coding, the write-up, and the conceptual quiz. The format of the coding component is similar to the seven prior projects. There is no limit to the number of submissions on Sail() for the coding component. The final grade of this component is based on the most recent submission, not the submission with the highest score.

There is a set of write-up questions at the end of the coding component. Students type the responses directly into the notebook and submit a pdf or images of such work to Gradescope for manual grading.

The conceptual component of the final exam is administered on OLI. It is a summative assessment of all conceptual materials taught in the course. This component is independent of the coding and the write-up components and can be started at any time during the final exam period.

All of the three components of the final exam must be completed within the final exam window. Strictly no extension will be granted for the final exam.

### Online Programming Exercise (OPE)

On the Sail() Platform, you will also see three OPE (Online Programming Exercise) activities. These are synchronous team-based exercises to prepare you for the upcoming projects. Each OPE is associated with a project and accounts for 5% of that project’s grade. The first project, “Project 0: Getting Started,” and the first OPE, “OPE: Practice,” are ungraded.
