Inline activities (“Learn by Doing” and “Did I Get This”), which are available on most pages in the OLI course, are simple, non-graded activities to assess your comprehension of the material as you read through the course material. You are advised to complete all of the inline activities before proceeding through to the next page or module. If you missed many of the activities, it is recommended that you review the material again.

There are eight units consisting of modules of content on OLI. There are 11 Checkpoint quizzes that you must complete before the deadline posted on OLI. The quiz with the lowest score will be dropped. Among the 10 Checkpoint quizzes to be counted towards the final grade, each Checkpoint quiz will be worth 2% of your total grade. It is your responsibility to ensure that the quiz is submitted prior to the deadline. You will have only a single attempt and a fixed time limit to complete each Checkpoint Quiz on OLI.

This course includes seven individual project themes. Each project theme consists of several project modules. A project module has to be completed based on the deadlines posted on Sail() Platform. The write-up required to complete each project module is available on Sail() Platform. Each module has a submission process that is specific to the project module that is due. It is the students’ responsibility to make sure that all project work is completed and that the project module is submitted prior to the deadline.  Students typically have multiple attempts to submit the project module on Sail() Platform.

On the Sail() Platform, you will also see three OPE (Online Programming Exercise) activities. These are synchronous team-based exercises to prepare you for the upcoming projects. Each OPE is associated with a project and accounts for 5% of that project’s grade. The first project, “Project 0: Getting Started,” and the first OPE, “OPE: Practice,” are ungraded.
