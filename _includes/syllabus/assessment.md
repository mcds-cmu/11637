## OLI Torus

### Practice Quiz
Practice quizzes are non-graded retrieval practices to access your understanding of the reading materials on OLI Torus. Completing the practice quizzes provides excellent signals on your weekly summative (graded) in-class quizzes.

You are strongly recommended to complete the practice quiz before the synchronous in-class quiz. If you missed many of the questions in the quiz, it is suggested that you review the material again.

### Weekly In-Class Quiz
Each week, during synchronous class meeting time, students will spend 10 minutes of class time completing the quiz. The quiz assesses the reading contents on OLI Torus the preceding week and is graded. When it is time to take the quiz, students log into OLI Torus to start. A timer will activate once the quiz starts and cannot be paused. The quiz will automatically stop after the time allowance. The student’s work will automatically be submitted and graded by the OLI Torus system.

Students will have only a single attempt to complete the weekly quiz on OLI Torus. 

## Sail()

This course includes seven individual project themes. Each project theme consists of several project modules. A project module must be completed based on the deadlines on Sail() Platform. The write-up required to complete each project module is available on Sail() Platform. Each module has a submission process that is specific to the project module that is due. It is the student's responsibility to ensure all project work is completed and the project module is submitted before the deadline. Students typically have multiple attempts to submit the project module on Sail() Platform.

The first project, “Project 0: Getting Started,” is ungraded.

## Online Programming Exercise (OPE)
On the Sail() Platform, you will also see two OPE (Online Programming Exercise) activities: a practice OPE and an OPE after Project 3. These are synchronous team-based exercises to expand your knowledge on the topics of the preceding projects. Each OPE is associated with a project and accounts for 5% of that project's grade. The first OPE, "OPE: Practice," is ungraded.

## Manual-graded Components
In Project 3 and the final exam, some components are manually graded questions. Students must submit a pdf or images of their work on Gradescope for manual grading.

## Final Exam
There are three components to the final exam: the coding, the write-up, and the conceptual quiz. The format of the coding component is similar to the seven prior projects. There is no limit to the number of submissions on Sail() for the coding component. The final grade of this component is based on the most recent submission, not the submission with the highest score.

There is a set of write-up questions at the end of the coding component. Students type the responses directly into the notebook and submit a pdf or images of such work to Gradescope for manual grading.
The conceptual component of the final exam is administered on OLI Torus. It is a summative assessment of all conceptual materials taught in the course. This component is independent of the coding and the write-up components. It can be started at any time during the final exam period.

All three components of the final exam must be completed within the final exam window. Strictly no extension will be granted for the final exam.

## End-of-course Survey
An end-of-course survey will be distributed around the final exam week. The survey aims to gather constructive feedback from students for further improvement and development of the course. To thank you for your time, students will be awarded 2% of the overall course grade for survey completion.
