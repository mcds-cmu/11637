## Conceptual Learning Objectives

The conceptual learning objectives are below. Students will be able to:

1. Describe the phases of the data science project lifecycle and articulate the interaction between them to inform the development of analytic solutions.

2. Formulate analytic objectives to produce actionable business/scientific insights from data and then formulate functional and non-functional requirements for an envisioned data-driven solution to a business/research problem.

3. Examine and describe the formal characteristics of the data collection process. Apply the fundamental concepts in the data collection process to a dataset for analysis by machine learning methods.

4. Compare and contrast different techniques of representing the domain as feature vectors; explore how different featurization of a dataset influence trained model performance and task utility.

5. Explain different analysis techniques using the same linear/logistic regression model at its core (“gatekeeper” task) and interpret domain problems as instances of data science task patterns, including classification, regression, ranking, and clustering.

6. Explain basic principles of how the bias-variance tradeoff affects model choice and configuration, and then describe how information available for domain problems can become a dataset on which models can be trained.

7. Identify ways to improve the representation, model, and/or experiment towards the analytic objective and explain quantitative evaluation metrics for various data science task patterns.

## Getting help

Students are encouraged to ask questions about content and projects through Piazza, where an online class portal has been created for this course. 

There is video recording of a weekly overview that is made available to all students. The teaching staff will discuss any major questions that have been posted to Piazza or by email. For urgent communication with the teaching staff, it is best to post on Piazza and then send an email.  

We will use the course website as the basic portal for the class. The course content is entirely on OLI.

The project write-ups, submission, scoreboard, and grades are on Sail() Platform. The checkpoint quizzes are on OLI. OLI can be accessed through Canvas. Announcements, discussions, and questions are posted on Piazza.
